# About Me

Hi there! I’m **Prince Agyapong**, a statistician who enjoys turning messy clinical data into clean, meaningful insights that help move science forward.

My journey started with a **Bachelor’s degree in Statistics** from the **University of Ghana**, followed by a **Master’s degree in Statistics** from **South Dakota State University**, where I spent just as much time wrangling R code as I did tutoring students and diving deep into health data.

Today, I’m working as a **Statistician at Pentara Corporation**, where I spend my days reviewing statistical analysis plans, building datasets, and crafting the tables and plots that power regulatory submissions. I love the challenge of working on both early-phase and late-phase clinical trials, especially when I get to run Bayesian simulations or build custom R functions that make reporting faster and cleaner.

Before joining industry, I led a meta-analysis exploring how social determinants impact mortality in end-stage kidney disease. I also taught college algebra (yes, the part where students either thank you or cry a little).

In short, I’m passionate about combining solid statistical methods with good communication and clean code. My goal is to help bring better treatments to the people who need them.
