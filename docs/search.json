    "text": "Hi there! I’m Prince Agyapong, a statistician who enjoys turning messy clinical data into clean, meaningful insights that help move science forward.\nMy journey started with a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from the University of Ghana, followed by a Master’s degree in Statistics from South Dakota State University, where I spent just as much time wrangling R code as I did tutoring students and diving deep into health data.\nToday, I’m working as a Statistician at Pentara Corporation, where I spend my days reviewing statistical analysis plans, building datasets, and crafting the tables and plots that power regulatory submissions. I love the challenge of working on both early-phase and late-phase clinical trials.\nBefore joining industry, I led a meta-analysis exploring how social determinants impact mortality in end-stage kidney disease. I also taught college algebra (yes, the part where students either thank you or cry a little).\nIn short, I’m passionate about combining solid statistical methods with good communication and clean code. My goal is to help bring better treatments to the people who need them.\nWant to know more? Check out my projects or find me on LinkedIn."

    "title": "Site Reliability Analysis in Hypertension Treatment Clinical Trial",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis project explores site-level reliability using a synthetic dataset modeled after a Phase III randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a hypertension treatment (CardioX) compared to an active comparator and placebo. The dataset includes 1,000 patients enrolled across 50 trial sites, with comprehensive data on demographics, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, dropout rates, and adverse events. The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nRates and Ranks\nTo begin the assessment of site reliability, average rates or values were calculated for each risk factor at every clinical trial site. These included the average dropout rate, adverse event (AE) rate, and average measurements of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and cholesterol level.\nEach site was ranked based on its performance across the selected risk factors. Rankings were assigned in descending order so that sites with better performance (lower risk) received higher rank values, and sites with poorer performance (higher risk) received lower rank values. Tied values were given the average of their ranks. The ranking process was applied separately for dropout rate, adverse event rate, average systolic blood pressure, average diastolic blood pressure, and average cholesterol level.\n\n\nShow Code\n# Rank each metric\nsite_ranked &lt;- site_summary %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Dropout_Rank = rank(-Dropout_Rate, ties.method = \"average\", na.last = \"keep\"),\n    AE_Rank = rank(-AE_Rate, ties.method = \"average\", na.last = \"keep\"),\n    Systolic_Rank = rank(-Systolic_Mean, ties.method = \"average\", na.last = \"keep\"),\n    Diastolic_Rank = rank(-Diastolic_Mean, ties.method = \"average\", na.last = \"keep\"),\n    Cholesterol_Rank = rank(-Cholesterol_Mean, ties.method = \"average\", na.last = \"keep\")\n  )\n\n# Convert to long format\nrank_long &lt;- site_ranked %&gt;%\n  select(Site_ID, ends_with(\"_Rank\")) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"_Rank\"),\n    names_to = \"RF\",\n    values_to = \"Rank_Value\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    RF = case_when(\n      RF == \"Dropout_Rank\" ~ \"Dropout Rate\",\n      RF == \"AE_Rank\" ~ \"Adverse Event Rate\",\n      RF == \"Systolic_Rank\" ~ \"Average Systolic BP\",\n      RF == \"Diastolic_Rank\" ~ \"Average Diastolic BP\",\n      RF == \"Cholesterol_Rank\" ~ \"Average Cholesterol Level\",\n      TRUE ~ RF\n    )\n  )\n\nrank_long\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAn overall rank was calculated for each site by averaging its ranks across all five risk factors. This average rank provides a composite indicator of site performance, allowing for a unified comparison of site-level data quality and reliability.\n\n\nShow Code\n# Compute average rank per site\navg_rank &lt;- rank_long %&gt;%\n  group_by(Site_ID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Rank_Value = mean(Rank_Value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\navg_rank\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nK-means Clustering\nTo determine the optimal number of site clusters, the average silhouette width was calculated for K values ranging from 2 to 10. The silhouette method evaluates how well each site fits within its assigned cluster, with higher values indicating better cohesion and separation. The plot showed that \\(K=3\\) yielded the highest average silhouette width, suggesting three distinct clusters best represent the variation in average site ranks.\n\n\nShow Code\n# K means clustering \nset.seed(117)\n# Function to calculate average silhouette width\ncalculate_silhouette &lt;- function(k) {\n  kmeans_result &lt;- kmeans(avg_rank$Rank_Value, centers = k, nstart = 10)\n  sil &lt;- silhouette(kmeans_result$cluster, dist(avg_rank$Rank_Value))\n  mean(sil[, \"sil_width\"])\n}\n\n# Compute silhouette scores for k = 2 to 10\nk_values &lt;- 2:10\nsilhouette_scores &lt;- sapply(k_values, calculate_silhouette)\n\n# Create a data frame for plotting\nsil_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  K = k_values,\n  Silhouette = silhouette_scores\n)\n\n# Plot using ggplot2\nggplot(sil_df, aes(x = K, y = Silhouette)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Silhouette Plot: Optimal Number of Clusters\",\n    x = \"Number of Clusters (K)\",\n    y = \"Average Silhouette Width\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:10) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\n# Run k-means\nkmeans_result &lt;- kmeans(avg_rank$Rank_Value, centers = 3, nstart = 10)\n\n# Create a lookup table for cluster centers and risk labels\ncluster_labels &lt;- tibble(\n  cluster = 1:3,\n  center = as.numeric(kmeans_result$centers)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(center)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(site_risk = c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"))\n\n# Attach cluster and site_risk to avg_rank\navg_rank &lt;- avg_rank %&gt;%\n  mutate(cluster = kmeans_result$cluster) %&gt;%\n  left_join(cluster_labels, by = \"cluster\")  \n\np &lt;- ggplot(avg_rank, aes(x = Rank_Value, fill = factor(site_risk, levels = c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\")))) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, alpha = 0.6, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_vline(data = cluster_labels, aes(xintercept = center), \n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"High\" = \"red\", \"Medium\" = \"blue\", \"Low\" = \"forestgreen\")) +\n  labs(title = \"K-Means Clustering on Average Rank\",\n       x = \"Average Rank Value\",\n       y = \"Number of Sites\",\n       fill = \"Site Risk\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\nSites were clustered using k-means based on their average rank across risk factors, where higher ranks indicate better site performance. After clustering, risk labels were assigned in descending order of the cluster centers: the cluster with the highest average rank was labeled Low risk, followed by Medium, and the cluster with the lowest average rank labeled High risk.\nThus, Low-risk sites had the highest average ranks, suggesting consistently favorable performance across the ranked metrics. In contrast, High-risk sites had the lowest average ranks, indicating potential concerns such as underreporting, protocol non-adherence, or other data integrity issues\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of average site rankings.

Dropout Rate\nSites classified as high risk exhibit higher dropout rates than those categorized as medium or low risk. This trend may reflect challenges related to participant engagement or site operations, potentially impacting retention and overall study quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Adverse Event Rate\nAdverse event rates are skewed higher for high risk sites, with some reporting unusually elevated rates. This could point to over-reporting, inconsistent AE definitions, or poor protocol adherence, which are often signs of unreliable data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Average Systolic BP\nHigh-risk sites report higher and more variable average systolic blood pressure levels. Although elevated BP is expected in this population, the degree of variation and inflation at high-risk sites may suggest inadequate blood pressure control, protocol non-adherence, or measurement inconsistencies. In contrast, lower-risk sites show more consistent and moderate readings, suggesting more reliable data capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Average Diastolic BP\nHigh-risk sites report higher and more variable average diastolic blood pressure readings. This wider spread may indicate inconsistent measurement techniques, protocol deviations, or site-level data quality concerns, similar to the systolic BP findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Average Cholesterol Level\nCholesterol levels appear elevated and right-shifted at high-risk sites compared to others. This pattern may indicate potential lab calibration issues, data entry errors, or differences in patient selection, such as enrolling individuals with higher baseline cardiovascular risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics of Risk Factors\nHigh vs Low\nLow-risk sites had significantly higher rank values than high-risk sites for systolic blood pressure (mean difference = 24.83, p &lt; 0.001) and adverse event rate (mean difference = 19.79, p &lt; 0.001). These large and statistically significant differences suggest that low-risk sites are much more consistent in their reporting of expected clinical patterns or completeness. The lower ranks at high-risk sites point to potential underreporting or data quality issues that may compromise the reliability of the information collected at those locations.\n\n\nShow Code\n# Create summary tables for  risk factor (RF)\n# comparisons across site risk groups: High vs Low, Medium vs Low, High vs Medium\n# Risk factors: High vs Low\nrfs &lt;- unique(rfs_data$RF)\n\nhl_rfs &lt;- map2_dfr(\n  rfs,\n  seq_along(rfs),\n  function(rf, i) {\n    tbl &lt;- summary_statistics(\n      dsin = rfs_data |&gt; \n        filter(RF == rf, site_risk %in% c(\"High\", \"Low\")) |&gt; \n        mutate(site_risk = factor(site_risk, levels = c(\"High\", \"Low\"))),\n      numvars = \"Rank_Value\",\n      by = \"RF\",\n      group = \"site_risk\",\n      mean_diffs = TRUE,\n      ci_diffs = TRUE,\n      pval_diffs = TRUE,\n      overall = FALSE\n    ) |&gt;\n      mutate(RF = if_else(STAT == \"N\", RF, \"\")) |&gt;\n      select(-c(VARIABLE, VARTYPE, STATORD))\n    \n    if (i &lt; length(rfs)) {\n      blank_row &lt;- tbl[1, ] |&gt; mutate(across(everything(), ~ \"\"))\n      bind_rows(tbl, blank_row)\n    } else {\n      tbl\n    }\n  }\n)\n\nhl_rfs |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    STAT = \"Statistic\",\n    RF = \"Risk Factor\",\n    Low = \"Low Risk\",\n    High = \"High Risk\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_caption(\"Comparison of Summary Statistics for Low and High Risk Sites\") |&gt;\n  opt_table_font(font = list(gt::google_font(\"Roboto Condensed\"), default_fonts())) |&gt;\n  opt_table_outline() |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.font.size = px(14),\n    data_row.padding = px(4),\n    heading.title.font.size = px(16),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n    column_labels.background.color = \"skyblue\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Summary Statistics for Low and High Risk Sites\n\n\nRisk Factor\nStatistic\nHigh Risk\nLow Risk\n\n\n\n\nDropout Rate\nN\n12\n10\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n19.79 (16.23)\n36.20 (9.98)\n\n\n\nMedian\n15.75\n39.50\n\n\n\n(Q1, Q3)\n7.50, 25.62\n30.88, 43.50\n\n\n\nMin, Max\n1.00, 49.00\n18.50, 46.00\n\n\n\nMean Difference\n\n16.41 (5.90)\n\n\n\n95% CI of Difference\n\n-28.71, -4.11\n\n\n\nDifference p-value\n\n0.012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Event Rate\nN\n12\n10\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n14.96 (10.96)\n34.75 (11.36)\n\n\n\nMedian\n13.75\n34.75\n\n\n\n(Q1, Q3)\n7.50, 18.25\n26.88, 42.75\n\n\n\nMin, Max\n1.00, 38.00\n14.00, 50.00\n\n\n\nMean Difference\n\n19.79 (4.77)\n\n\n\n95% CI of Difference\n\n-29.74, -9.84\n\n\n\nDifference p-value\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Systolic BP\nN\n12\n10\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n15.67 (11.70)\n40.50 (7.00)\n\n\n\nMedian\n12.00\n40.00\n\n\n\n(Q1, Q3)\n7.75, 21.00\n35.25, 46.75\n\n\n\nMin, Max\n3.00, 45.00\n31.00, 50.00\n\n\n\nMean Difference\n\n24.83 (4.22)\n\n\n\n95% CI of Difference\n\n-33.65, -16.02\n\n\n\nDifference p-value\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Diastolic BP\nN\n12\n10\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n17.67 (12.88)\n35.20 (11.20)\n\n\n\nMedian\n15.50\n38.50\n\n\n\n(Q1, Q3)\n8.75, 24.25\n31.25, 41.50\n\n\n\nMin, Max\n2.00, 45.00\n14.00, 49.00\n\n\n\nMean Difference\n\n17.53 (5.20)\n\n\n\n95% CI of Difference\n\n-28.39, -6.68\n\n\n\nDifference p-value\n\n0.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Cholesterol Level\nN\n12\n10\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n19.17 (12.12)\n33.70 (14.86)\n\n\n\nMedian\n19.00\n38.50\n\n\n\n(Q1, Q3)\n10.75, 27.75\n26.75, 44.75\n\n\n\nMin, Max\n1.00, 38.00\n5.00, 50.00\n\n\n\nMean Difference\n\n14.53 (5.75)\n\n\n\n95% CI of Difference\n\n-26.52, -2.54\n\n\n\nDifference p-value\n\n0.020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium vs Low\nSystolic blood pressure (mean difference = 16.14, p = 0.001) and dropout rate (mean difference = 12.08, p = 0.015) ranked significantly higher at low-risk sites than at medium-risk sites.

Medium-risk sites also performed better than high-risk sites, especially in the reporting of adverse events. These findings support the validity of the site classification and suggest that high-risk sites may be affected by protocol deviations, underreporting, or other operational issues that compromise data reliability.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nTargeted monitoring should be considered for high-risk sites to investigate possible causes of poor data quality.\nSite retraining or audits may help reinforce protocol adherence and improve reporting accuracy.\nContinuous rank-based surveillance can be incorporated into risk-based monitoring workflows to proactively flag emerging issues.\nFurther investigation into operational challenges at high-risk sites may offer insights to prevent similar issues in future trials."
